### Step 2: Push Your Project to GitHub

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project folder:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd D:\xampp\htdocs\ITP110_MLAB2

git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Coffee Shop SPA"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/coffee-shop-spa.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** If this is your first time using Git, you might need to configure it:

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Routes show 404 on refresh
**Solution:** The `vercel.json` file should fix this. If it doesn't work:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Problem: Build fails
**Solution:** Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project on vercel.com
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Check the "Building" section for errors
4. Common fixes:
   - Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Check for typos in imports
   - Ensure all files are committed to Git

### Problem: Images not loading
**Solution:** Make sure image URLs are absolute (starting with https://)
- Your project already uses external image URLs, so this should work fine

### Problem: Can't push to GitHub
**Solution:**
```bash
# If you get authentication error, use personal access token
# Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
# Generate new token, then use it as password when pushing
```

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Go to your project on Vercel
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
